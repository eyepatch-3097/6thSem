  <p><b>5/5/2021:</b> This webpage is a collective effort of the UG Economics, Batch of 2018-21. At the crucial hour of need, I have personally seen several individuals of my batch and other acquaintances, take up the initiative to help those who are in dire need for resources. Not just academic help, but people have provided moral support to others, listened to each other's problems, comforted their friends and family and most of all, reached out even when they had no need to do it. That said, it has not been an easy ride for the students. Stuck with the mediocre quality of online classes and struggling with the lack of empathy from authorities, a lot of students have no resources to enjoy any particular mode of education. Hence, this webpage is a specific attempt at helping the current UG 6th semester batch come to a single point where all resources relevant to the Economics syllabus has been collected.</p>
  <p>I want to clarify that all the materials here are not collected by one person. Over the weeks, several people have helped me curate the content, get the requisite papers together, and also cleared my personal doubts. Therefore, the content that is present here and will be added later, is a collaborative effort of many students who are working hard to help the fellow students. If you face any issue with the website, you can contact me personally on Whatsapp, I'm sure you can find my number. If you still can't, you can send me an email at <b>siddharth3098@gmail.com</b> , you can send other suggestions there as well. If you have a particular material to add, this is also the way to go, I'm sure we can discuss the content and add it if it is valuable. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can use this <a href="https://forms.gle/DpV2oDbJZdqts6NcA" target="_blank">form</a> to help.</p>
  <p>All that said, please continue using the website. I will proceed to updating the website whenever needed. None of this is possible, without the help of others, so I want to thank everyone who has been a kind soul and helped me with this. Hope you find whatever you are looking for here.</p>
